ðŸŒŸ My AddFriend JS Project! ðŸŒŸ

Iâ€™m thrilled to showcase my Add Friend Card Project, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate DOM manipulation and interactive functionality. ðŸš€

âœ¨ Whatâ€™s Inside:
ðŸ”¹ HTML: A structured layout for user-friendly cards.
ðŸ”¹ CSS: Sleek, modern design with responsive styling.
ðŸ”¹ JavaScript:

DOM Manipulation: Dynamically create, update, and manage friend cards.
Event Listeners: Interactive buttons for adding, editing, or removing cards.
Functionality: Seamless user interactions for a smooth experience.
This project reflects the practical use of JS Events and DOM APIs, wrapped in a visually appealing interface.
